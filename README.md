# ðŸ¥¯ bagel

Interpreter implementation for the Lox programming language. This is part of the CodeCrafter challenge "Build your own Interpreter" which provides step by step path to achieve this, with tests that must pass to continue to the next stage.

## Crates

- `bagel` is the tree-walk interpreter implementation
- `salmon` is the bytecode virtual machine interpreter implementation
- `kitchen` contains the integration tests that tests both implementations
