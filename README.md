# ðŸ¥¯ A Lox Interpreter

Interpreter implementation for the Lox programming language following the "Crafting Interpreters" book by Robert Nystrom. It is also set up to be submitted to CodeCrafters to pass their tests for their "Build your own Interpreter" challenge

## Crates

- `bagel` is the tree-walk interpreter implementation
- `salmon` is the bytecode virtual machine interpreter implementation
- `kitchen` contains the integration tests that tests both implementations
